## Getting Started

### Without Docker
To run the project locally, ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) installed. Follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies for the monorepo (concurrently), backend API, and frontend web application.
```
npm run setup
```
3. Start the backend API and frontend web application.
```
npm run dev
```
4. Access the frontend web application at http://localhost:3000.

#### Server Environment Variables
Before running the backend API, make sure to set the following environment variables in a `.env` file for the server (located in the `server/` directory):
```
cp server/.env-sample server/.env
```

- `PORT`: The port on which the server should listen.
- `CLIENT_URL`: The URL of the frontend application.
- `LOCATION_URL`: The URL for BC government repositories. (https://api.github.com/user/bcgov/repos)

#### Client Environment Variables
For the frontend web application, set the following environment variable in a `.env` file for the client (located in the `client/` directory):
```
cp client/.env-sample client/.env
```

- `VITE_API_URL`: The backend API endpoint URL for making requests from the client.


### Using Docker
To run the project with Docker, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Make sure you have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed and running.
3. In the project root directory, build the Docker containers using Docker Compose (Compose V2).
```
docker compose up --build
```
4. Access the frontend web application at http://localhost:3000.

## Backend API
The backend API serves as the data source for the frontend web application. It includes the following endpoints:
- `/api/health`: Returns a 200 response indicating the API is healthy.
- `/api/products`: CRUD endpoints for products.
    - GET `/api/products`: Returns a list of all products.
    - GET `/api/products/:id`: Returns a product by ID.
    - POST `/api/products`: Creates a new product.
    - PUT `/api/products/:id`: Updates a product by ID.
    - DELETE `/api/products/:id`: Deletes a product by ID.
- `/api/api-docs`: Bonus Swagger documentation for API endpoints.

## Frontend Web Application
The frontend web application provides a user-friendly interface for managing products. It includes:
- Product listing and viewing.
- Form for adding and editing products.
- Button for deleting products.
- Bonus: Search functionality for Scrum Masters and Developers.
